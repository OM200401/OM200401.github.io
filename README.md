# Portfolio Website

## About 
The website is a personal project made using TS, HTML and TailwindCSS in the NextJS framework. It displays my ability to create a website using several different languages and shows understanding of front-end development. It has helped me a lot in getting
better at coding and in having clean and good coding practices.   

## How to get the website running 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
